    question: "How does this program make my workouts?",
    answer: "FlexFit utilizes GPT-4 in order to take in variables and produce unique, personalized fitness programs tailored towards every user!"
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't have workout equipment?",
    answer: "That's why FlexFit is here! Our program can take even the most basic objects and create a unique workout that will guarantee a sweat! For example, try adding your dog, a cup of coffee, and a bag of skittles to the equipment ;)"
  },
  {
    question: "How does FlexFit keep track of my progress?",
    answer: "As of right now, there is no way for FlexFit to track your current progress. If this project gets enough attention and support then keep on the lookout for another update!"
  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm really lazy about planning my workouts?",
    answer: "No worries! In our Multi-step form, you will be prompted to select days of the week when you can/want to workout. After that, you will be given different workouts for each selected day of the week."
  },
  {
    question: "Will this program help experienced lifters?",
    answer: "The short-answer is no. With a lack of machine learning, statistics, and study cases, the AI in charge of creating these workouts (as of right now) does not know how to structure a workout for experienced lifters. These workouts are meant for people starting, or getting back into fitness and want to find a way to have a fun workout."
