# FlexFit: AI-Powered Personalized Fitness Programs

FlexFit is an AI-powered workout planning application designed to create personalized fitness programs tailored to personal goals, equipment, and preferences. Whether you're walking your dog with a cup of coffee, or in your home gym, FlexFit is the perfect opportunity to start working out.

This program uses the power of the ChatGPT API to analyze your inputs and generate creative and effective workouts.

FlexFit will take in your:
- Gender
- Height
- Weight
- Fitness goal
- Select days to workout
- Available equipment


With these, FlexFit will utilize these variables to create a fun and creative workout for the user. The goal of this is to motivate a healthy and active lifestyle for everyone in any occasion.


### `Future Goals with FlexFit`
The beauty that I see within FlexFit, is that it allows the user to pick any "equipment" they want and generate a workout with it. Through more machine learning experience, I would like to connect to local gyms so you can generate an effective workout using the equipment the gym offers.

### Note on API Access
Currently, FlexFit is not open to the public as the application uses the ChatGPT API, which incurs costs based on token usage. Opening this to a broader audience would require upgrading to accommodate increased demand. For now, this project is designed as a proof of concept and is best suited for local or private use.
